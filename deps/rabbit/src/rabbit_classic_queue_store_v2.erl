%% The classic queue store works as follow:
%%
%% When a message needs to be written to disk, it is appended to
%% its corresponding segment file. An offset is returned and that
%% offset will be added to the #msg_status (in lieu of msg_id)
%% and eventually written to disk by the index as well.
%%
%% The corresponding segment file is found by looking at the
%% SeqId, just like the index. There's a 1:1 abstract mapping
%% between index segment files and store segment files. (But
%% whether there are two files for each segment is another
%% question.)
%%
%% Messages are only ever written once to the store. Messages
%% are not reference counted, and are not shared between queues.
%%
%% Messages cannot be removed from the message store individually.
%% Instead, when the index deletes one of its segment files, it
%% tells the queue to also delete the corresponding segment files
%% in the store. This means that store segment files can grow
%% very large because their size is only limited by the number
%% of entries in the index.
%%
%% Messages are synced to disk only when the index tells us
%% they should be. What this effectively means is that the
%% ?STORE:sync function is called right before the ?INDEX:sync
%% function, and only if there are outstanding confirms in the
%% index. As a result the store does not need to keep track of
%% confirms.
%%
%% The old rabbit_msg_store has separate transient/persistent stores
%% to make recovery of data on disk quicker. We do not need to
%% do this here, because the recovery is only done via the index,
%% which already knows about persistent messages and does not
%% need to look into the store to discard them. Messages on disk
%% will be dropped at the same time as the index deletes the
%% corresponding segment file.
%%
%% The file_handle_cache reservations are done by the v2 index
%% because they are handled at a pid level. Since we are using
%% up to 2 FDs in this module we make the index reserve 2 extra
%% FDs.
